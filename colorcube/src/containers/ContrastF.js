            Quality or Saturation, relates to the degree of purity of a color. Contrast of saturation is the contrast between pure, intense colors and dull diluted ones. Colors can be diluted in four different ways: adding white to the color, mixing it with black (for subtractive mixture), mixing it with gray, and with its complementary colors.

            <p className="text-left">
            For this exercise, the color selected can be diluted by adding white, grey and it&#8218;s complementary. The option of adding black is not possible since the project works with lights and black is equal to 0, the absence of light.

            KÃ¼ppers describes Saturation Contrast as a esthetic feature and calls it &#8220;Chromaticity or Achromaticity Degree&#8221;.
